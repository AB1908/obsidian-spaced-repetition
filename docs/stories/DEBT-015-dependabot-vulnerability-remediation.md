# DEBT-015: Dependabot Vulnerability Remediation Plan

## Status
Backlog

## Epic
None

## Depends on
- None

## Description
GitHub Dependabot currently reports multiple vulnerabilities (including critical severity) on the default branch. We need a controlled remediation plan that reduces risk without destabilizing plugin runtime behavior.

## Context
Risk areas likely include:
- outdated build/test toolchain packages
- transitive vulnerabilities pulled by legacy major versions
- potential Node runtime mismatch between local and CI/release workflows

Blind bulk upgrades are risky in this repository because release/build behavior and Obsidian compatibility are sensitive to toolchain changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inventory and categorize all open Dependabot alerts by package, severity, and direct/transitive ownership.
- [ ] Patch all critical and high severity alerts, or document explicit temporary exceptions with rationale and expiry date.
- [ ] Keep CI green (`npm test`, build, release workflow dry-run after updates).
- [ ] Validate plugin build artifacts still load correctly in Obsidian test vault.
- [ ] Document remaining moderate/low alerts and follow-up plan.

## Allowed Files
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `.github/workflows/*`
- `docs/guides/*`
- `docs/stories/DEBT-015-dependabot-vulnerability-remediation.md`

## Required Test Commands
- `npm test`
- `OBSIDIAN_PLUGIN_DIR=. npm run build`

## Tasks
- [ ] Capture Dependabot snapshot in this story (date-stamped).
- [ ] Upgrade direct dependencies in small batches by risk domain.
- [ ] Re-run tests/build after each batch.
- [ ] Address CI/runtime compatibility issues (for example Node action versions) as part of remediation.
- [ ] Close alerts and record residual risk.
