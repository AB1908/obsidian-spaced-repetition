# IDEA-002: Add "Go To Annotation Processing" CTA From Card Creation

## Description
When a user cannot find an annotation in card creation flow, provide a direct CTA to jump to the annotation processing flow.

## Why Capture
This needs product design decisions first:
- placement and prominence,
- source-type-specific copy,
- navigation target semantics,
- whether CTA appears always or conditionally.
