# Session: DEBT-016 — 2026-02-17

## Story
[DEBT-016](../stories/DEBT-016-stale-documentation.md)

## Goal
Align `workflow.md` to `work-organization.md` with no process bloat.

## Findings
- `workflow.md` was significantly out of date, referencing `docs/context/`, `docs/features/`, and `docs/todo/`.

## Decisions
- Removed stale templates from `workflow.md` and redirected to `work-organization.md`.
- Updated daily workflow examples to use `docs/stories/`.

## Next Steps
- Migrate session notes and update story files.
