Hint: one is temporal\n?\nRich in content but brief in duration\n<!--SR:5708!L,2024-03-30,13,190-->\n\nWhat is span in the context of short term memory?\n?\nIt is the amount of information able to be help in short term memory.\n<!--SR:5719!L,2024-01-13,26,230-->\n\nWhat is the one word term for the amount of information that is able to be held in short term memory?\n?\nSpan\n<!--SR:5719!L,2024-02-18,63,270-->\n\nWhat kind of context aids in retrieving information from memory?\n?\nSimilar physical or emotional context tends to aid retrieval.\n<!--SR:5762!L,2023-12-01,2,230-->\n\nWhat is the encoding specificity principle in memory research? (Hint: context)\n?\nWhat we are able to retrieve from memory depends on context of encoding and how closely the context matches during retrieval.\n<!--SR:5764!L,2024-01-02,17,190-->\n\nWhat we are able to retrieve depends largely on the context in which the information was encoded or classified, and to what extent this matches the retrieval context. What is this principle known as?\n?\nEncoding specificity principle\n<!--SR:5764!L,2025-01-27,316,270-->\n\nWhat is free recall?\n?\nRecall in response to these sorts of non-specific cues is generally termed free recall.\n<!--SR:5766!L,2024-04-22,36,230-->\n\nWhat is the term for recall in response to non specific cues?\n?\nFree recall\n<!--SR:5766!L,2024-03-13,83,290-->\n\nName a popular phenomenon demonstrating the issue of partial information access during free recall.\n?\nTip of the tongue phenomenon\n<!--SR:5768!L,2024-02-18,64,290-->\n\nWhat issue does the tip of the tongue phenomenon demonstrate?\n?\nIt demonstrates partial access to information at the time of recall.\n<!--SR:5768!L,2024-03-11,81,270-->\n\nHow can one achieve the best recall with regards to context?\n?\nContext at encoding and context at retrieval should match as closely as possible.\n<!--SR:5793!L,2024-02-24,70,270-->\n\nWhat are the three components of the initial working memory model formalised by Baddeley?\n?\nPhonological loop, visuo spatial sketchpad, central executive\n<!--SR:5721!L,2023-12-21,3,250-->\n\nBaddeley later added a fourth component to the original working memory model.
