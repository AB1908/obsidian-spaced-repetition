For example, Plato regarded memory as being like a wax tablet, on which impressions would be made or encoded, and subsequently stored, so that we could return to and retrieve these impressions (i.e. memories) at a later time. This tripartite distinction between encoding, storage and retrieval has persisted among scientific investigators to the present day.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5688\n> Thinking along these lines has led many contemporary researchers to regard the mechanisms underlying memory as being best characterized as a dynamic activity or process rather than as a static entity or thing.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5690\n> Bartlett referred to this key characteristic of memory as ‘reconstructive’, as opposed to ‘reproductive’. In other words, instead of reproducing the original event or story, wederivea reconstruction based on our existing presuppositions, expectations and our ‘mental set’.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5691\n> Bartlett argued that, in a more naturalistic setting, this effort after meaning is one of the most significant features of the way our memory works in the real world.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5693\n> Indeed, a constructivist approach describes memory as the combined influences of the world and the person’s own ideas and expectations.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5694\n> This seems especially likely to happen when a memory is told and retold, with different influences present at each time of retrieval (see the reference to Bartlett’s techniques of serial and repeated reproduction cited in the box on page 15). In such situations, the ‘re-constructed’ memory often seems as real as the ‘recollected’ memory.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5695\n> In the light of these considerations, the act of remembering has been likened to the task of a paleontologist who constructs a dinosaur from an incomplete set of bones, but who possesses a great deal of general knowledge about dinosaurs. In this analogy, the past event leaves us with access to an incomplete set of bones (with occasional ‘foreign’ bones that are not derived from the past event at all). Our knowledge of the world then influences our efforts to re-assemble those bones into something that resembles the past episode. The memory that we assemble may contain some actual elements of the past (i.e. some real bones), but – taken as a whole – it is an imperfect re-construction of the past located in the present.\n> ***\n> \n\n# Chapter 2: Mapping memories\n\n> [!notes] 5697\n> The central point will be made that any memory system, whether it be the human brain (sometimes referred to as the ‘most complex system in the known universe’), the hard disk of a PC, a video recorder, or a humble office filing cabinet, needs to be able to i) encode, ii) store, and iii) retrieve information effectively if it is to function well as a memory system.\n> ***\n> \n\n## The logic of memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval\n\n> [!notes] 5700\n> With retrieval, an important distinction is often made between availability and accessibility.\n> ***\n> 1\n\n> [!notes] 5701\n> One has an enormous amount of information stored in one’s memory that is potentially available at any given moment, but there is typically only a small portion of information available for access at any given time.\n> ***\n> 2\n\n## Different kinds of memory: the functional structure of remembering\n\n> [!notes] 5704\n> Multistore (or modal) model of memory, first described in 1968 by Atkinson and Shiffrin. This model has offered a very useful heuristic framework for an understanding of memory\n> ***\n> 1\n\n> [!notes] 5705\n> Sensory store\n> ***\n> 2###\n\n> [!notes] 5706\n> An example of this is the ‘cocktail party phenomenon’, where we hear our name mentioned in a conversation elsewhere in the room, automatically diverting our attention to that other conversation.\n> ***\n> cloze\n\n> [!notes] 5707\n> Objective evidence for sensory memory stores came from experiments such as that conducted by Sperling in 1960.\n> ***\n> 3\n\n> [!notes] 5708\n> The sensory memory for visual information has been termed iconic memory, while sensory memory for auditory information has been referred to as echoic memory. Sensory memories are generally characterized as being rich (in terms of their content) but very brief (in terms of their duration).\n> ***\n> 4\n\n> [!notes] 5709\n> Short-term memory\n> ***\n> 5###\n\n> [!notes] 5710\n> Paying attention to something transfers it to short-term memory (sometimes referred to as primary memory or the short-term store), which has a capacity of around seven items.\n> ***\n> 6\n\n> [!notes] 5711\n> Within the scientific literature, the verbal short-term store has received considerable attention. Its existence has been inferred – at least in part – from the recency effect in free recall.\n> ***\n> 7\n\n> [!notes] 5712\n> Long-term memory\n> ***\n> 8###\n\n> [!notes] 5713\n> By contrast with acoustic representation of information in the short-term store, information in long-term memory is thought to be stored primarily in terms of the meaning of the information.\n> ***\n> 9\n\n> [!notes] 5715\n> Two major responses followed recognition of the problems with Atkinson and Shiffrin’s information-processing model.\n> ***\n> 10\n\n> [!notes] 5716\n> Whichever specific memory model is ultimately the most compelling, many theories of memory make a general but fundamental distinction between short-term and long-term memory processes.\n> ***\n> 11\n\n> [!notes] 5717\n> Working memory\n> ***\n> 12##\n\n> [!notes] 5718\n> Considering further the short-term store, the distinction between short-term memory and working memory is often blurred.\n> ***\n> 13\n\n> [!notes] 5719\n> The term span is often used to refer to the amount of information that a person is able to hold within short-term memory.\n> ***\n> 14\n\n> [!notes] 5720\n> There’s now good evidence that working memory is not a single entity, but that it is made up of at least three components (see Figure 6).\n> ***\n> 15\n\n> [!notes] 5721\n> Baddeley has formalized these components in his influential working memory model as a central executive and two so-called ‘slave’ systems – the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad.\n> ***\n> 16\n> \n> Also, very interesting that I now came across the idea that [[Ali Abdaal]] talked about.\n\n> [!notes] 5722\n> Subsequently, Baddeley added an episodic buffer in his revised working memory model.\n> ***\n> 17\n\n> [!notes] 5723\n> components, it is proposed that i) the central executive controls attention and coordinates the slave systems, ii) the phonological loop contains a phonological store and an articulatory control process and is responsible for inner speech, iii) the visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for setting up and manipulating mental images, and iv) the episodic buffer (not shown) integrates and manipulates material in working memory.\n> ***\n> 18\n\n> [!notes] 5724\n> Phonological loop\n> ***\n> 19###\n\n> [!notes] 5725\n> It has been shown that one’s memory span – i.e. the number of words that one can hear and then repeat back without error – is a function of the length of time that it takes to say the words.\n> ***\n> 20\n\n> [!notes] 5726\n> These and other findings indicate that the phonological loop is time- (rather than item-) limited.\n> ***\n> 21\n\n> [!notes] 5727\n> Visuo-spatial sketchpad\n> ***\n> 22###\n\n> [!notes] 5728\n> By contrast, the visuo-spatial sketchpad provides a medium for the temporary storage and manipulation of images.\n> ***\n> 23\n\n> [!notes] 5729\n> Central executive\n> ***\n> 24###\n\n> [!notes] 5730\n> It is thought to mediate the attentional and strategic aspects of working memory, and may be involved in co-ordinating cognitive resources between the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad, if both are active simultaneously\n> ***\n> 25\n\n> [!notes] 5731\n> It has been shown that the memory of expert chess players for positions taken from actual chess games was impaired by performance of the letter generation task but not by articulatory suppression, indicating that the central executive (but not the phonological loop) was involved in remembering the chess positions. \n> ***\n> 26\n\n> [!notes] 5732\n> The episodic buffer\n> ***\n> 27###\n\n> [!notes] 5733\n> information that is retrieved from long-term memory often needs to be integrated with respect to the current demands being fulfilled by working memory.

Semantic memory can be defined as knowledge that is retained irrespective of the circumstances under which it was acquired.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5740\n> How episodic memories become ‘converted’ into semantic memories over time remains an area of considerable research interest and speculation\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5741\n> For example, researchers have found that there are certain disorders of the brain that can preferentially affect semantic memory, such as ‘semantic dementia’.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5742\n> There seems to be general agreement that a third type of long-term memory –procedural memory (for example, performing the sequence of physical operations necessary to be able to ride a bicycle) – is independent of consciously accessible memory.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Explicit and implicit memory\n\n> [!notes] 5744\n> Within this framework, explicit memory is defined as involving conscious awareness, at the time of remembering, of the information, experience, or situation being remembered.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5745\n> Implicit memory, by contrast, refers to an influence on behaviour, feelings or thoughts as a result of prior experience, but which is manifested without conscious recollection of the original events.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Different kinds of memory task:  \n\n> [!notes] 5748\n> Some memory tasks require people to think about meanings and concepts; these are often referred to as concept-driven tasks.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5749\n> Other tasks require people to focus more on the presented materials; these are often referred to as data-driven tasks.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5750\n> Tasks that are proposed to tap, differentially, into explicit and implicit memory are sometimes also called direct and indirect memory tasks, respectively.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5751\n> Indeed, many researchers have argued that no memory task is truly ‘process pure’, in that each memory task will be mediated by a combination of implicit and explicit processes – it is the weighting of these processes that will differ across different memory tasks.\n> ***\n> \n\n## The experience of memory\n\n> [!notes] 5753\n> For example, it has been proposed that there is a valid distinction in memory between a person ‘remembering’ and ‘knowing’ something.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5754\n> This ‘remember’/‘know’ distinction was first used by Endel Tulving.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Levels of processing\n\n> [!notes] 5758\n> The problem – in essence – is how to devise a criterion of ‘depth’ and ‘shallowness’ of processing that is independent of subsequent memory performance.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5759\n> Similar to the framework articulated by Bartlett (Chapter 1), a key emphasis from the levels of processing framework is that we are active agents in the remembering process, such that what we remember depends on i) the processes that we ourselves engage in when we encounter a thing or an event, as well as ii) the properties of the thing or event itself.\n> ***\n> \n\n# Chapter 3: Pulling the rabbit out of the hat\n\n> [!notes] 5761\n> This chapter will consider how information is accessed from memory.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5762\n> The role of context seems to be especially important here: other things being equal, we tend to remember information better if we are in a similar physical context and emotional state at the time we wish to retrieve information as we were in at the time we were exposed to that information.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Inferring memory from behaviour\n\n> [!notes] 5764\n> What we are able to retrieve depends largely on the context in which the information was encoded or classified in the first place, and to what extent this matches the retrieval context – this is the so-called encoding specificity principle.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Retrieval: recall versus recognition\n\n> [!notes] 5766\n> Recall in response to these sorts of non-specific cues is generally termed free recall.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5767\n> As cues become more directive, the recall process is termed cued recall.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5768\n> The ‘tip of the tongue phenomenon’ (mentioned in Chapter 2) illustrates the nature of one common problem in free recall, in that we often have only partial access to information that we’re trying to retrieve.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5769\n> By comparison, cued recall is where we present a prompt (such as a category, or the first letter of the word) in order to retrieve a certain piece of information.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5770\n> Our ability to identify some past event or information when it is presented to us again is termed recognition.\n> ***\n> \n\n### Context retrieval\n\n> [!notes] 5772\n> This depends on ‘explicit recollection’ of time and place\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5773\n> So for this type of recognition, you need to be able to locate your previous experience in time and place.\n> ***\n> \n\n### Familiarity\n\n> [!notes] 5775\n> This type of recognition experience seems to be served by a ‘familiarity process’, but there is no explicit recollection of the previous encounter.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5776\n> It seems that in déjà vu, familiarity mechanisms may occur by mistake, so that a feeling of familiarity is triggered by a novel object or scene.\n> ***\n> \n\n## The effect of context on recall and recognition\n\n> [!notes] 5778\n> In two famous studies, Godden and Baddeley asked divers to remember information either on the shore or underwater. The divers were then tested either a) in the same context, or b) in a different context.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5779\n> These studies showed that the divers’ recall memory was strongly influenced by whether they were in the same context when they encoded the information as they were in for the memory test.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5780\n> However, this was only evident for recall, not for recognition memory.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5781\n> So we observe these state-dependent memory and forgetting effects, as well as physical context-dependent effects.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Unconscious influences on memory\n\n> [!notes] 5783\n> Even in the absence of recall, recognition or feelings of familiarity, memory may still be observable.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Categories versus continuum?\n\n> [!notes] 5785\n> We might consider the behaviours from which memory is inferred as existing along a continuum: free recall...cued recall...recognition...feeling of familiarity...unconscious behavioural influence.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5786\n> This view suggests that differences among these various manifestations of memory are due to the memories having different strengths or different availability.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5787\n> This approach is appealing in its simplicity, but there are potential difficulties with a simple continuum approach.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5788\n> For example, the ability to recall information does not always mean that the information will be correctly recognized.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5789\n> Furthermore, some variables have the opposite effect on recognition and recall performance, such as word frequency.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5790\n> The key point here is that different (and, perhaps, unexpected) outcomes may be obtained on specific memory parameters when memory encoding is directly manipulated.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Relating study and test\n\n> [!notes] 5792\n> This experiment demonstrates two important aspects of encoding specificity:\n>  \n> 1.   Only those elements of the original event that are specifically activated by the study situation are certain to be encoded.\n> 2.   For information to be optimally recalled, test cues need to target the particular aspects of the information that were originally encoded. In other words, remembering depends on the match between what is encoded and what is cued.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5793\n> So, to achieve the best recall, the type of processing involved when studying needs to be appropriately matched to the type of processing that will required at test.\n> ***\n> \n\n# Chapter 4: Inaccuracies in memory\n\n> [!notes] 5795\n> In this chapter, the question will be addressed of what underlies forgetting.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5796\n> The debate over whether we ever truly forget anything – or instead encounter difficulties retrieving stored information – will be considered.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5797\n> Other kinds of memory difficulty will also be discussed; for example, distortions and biases in memory induced by suggestion\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5798\n> We will also consider situations in which memory may work in a qualitatively more efficient manner, i.e. in so-called ‘flashbulb memory’ situations where it has been argued that memories may be especially vivid \n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5799\n> Related to this issue, we will consider emotional events impacting upon memory functioning, for example in situations of perceived threat or reward where we tend to retain information more efficiently.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Forgetting\n\n> [!notes] 5801\n> Forgetting can be defined as the loss of information that has been put into storage.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5802\n> There are two traditional views of forgetting.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5803\n> One view argues that memory simply fades or decays away, just as objects in the physical environment might fade or erode or tarnish over time. This view represents a more passive conceptualization of forgetting and memory.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5804\n> The second view regards forgetting as a more active process. According to this perspective, there is no strong evidence for the passive fading of information in memory, but forgetting occurs because memory traces are disrupted, obscured or overlaid by other memories. In other words, forgetting occurs as a consequence of interference.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5805\n> The consensus in the current literature is that both of these processes occur, but it is often quite difficult to separate the importance of time – i.e. the fading away or decay of memories – from interference through other events, because often these two things occur together.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5806\n> The more similar two experiences are, the greater the likelihood that they will interact in our memory.\n> ***\n> \n\n## Flashbulb memories and the reminiscence bump\n\n> [!notes] 5808\n> Two different aspects of this phenomenon are i) flashbulb memories and ii) the reminiscence bump\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5809\n> Many people are able to remember where they were and who they were with when they heard the news of one or all of these events. This is an example of what has been termed flashbulb memory.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5811\n> By comparison, the reminiscence bump occurs when people are asked during later life to remember events from across their lifespan. In these situations, people tend to remember disproportionately more events from the period between their adolescence and early adulthood.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5812\n> It has been suggested that this reminiscence bump is due to the particular significance of events that are occurring during the earlier portion of one’s life.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5813\n> The areas of flashbulb memories and the reminiscence bump are both quite controversial; for example, with respect to flashbulb memories, it has been questioned to what extent semantic memory may intrude upon episodic memory for events\n> ***\n> \n\n## Organization and errors in memory\n\n> [!notes] 5816\n> In the 1960s and 1970s, some studies were carried out on chess players to find out how well they could remember the positions of chess pieces on a board. The studies showed that chess masters could remember 95% of the pieces on the chessboard after a single 5-second glance. But weaker chess players were able to position only 40% of the pieces correctly, and needed eight attempts to reach 95% correct performance.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5817\n> In each case, it appears that the experts organize the material into a coherent and meaningful pattern. Drawing on a rich background of prior experience, experts seem to be able to enhance their memory performance significantly above that of non-experts\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5818\n> these studies of experts reveal the benefits of organization at the time of learning too.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5819\n> Therefore, meaningful organization of information during learning can sometimes lead to enhanced memory performance at test.\n> ***\n> \n\n## The effects of previous knowledge\n\n### Schemas – what we already know:  \n\n> [!notes] 5822\n> they had inserted, deleted, and modified information to produce stories that seemed more sensible to them – what Bartlett termed an ‘effort after meaning’.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5823\n> Bartlett proposed that we possess schemata (or schemas), which he described as active organizations of past experiences.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5824\n> People seemingly have trouble understanding presented information if they cannot draw upon schemas for previously acquired knowledge. This point was nicely illustrated in a study conducted by Bransford and Johnson.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5825\n> Bransford and Johnson found that it was only when the title of the piece (‘Washing Clothes’) was given in advance of the text that subsequent recall was improved.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5826\n> Bransford and Johnson found that it was only when the title of the piece (‘Washing Clothes’) was given in advance of the text that subsequent recall was improved.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5827\n> So it seems that providing a meaningful context improves memory\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5828\n> So it seems that providing a meaningful context improves memory\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5829\n> recognition of sentences from the passage was equivalent, with or without the title.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5830\n> recognition of sentences from the passage was equivalent, with or without the title.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5831\n> Alba and colleagues concluded that provision of the title allowed the participants to integrate the sentences into a more coherent unit, which benefited recall – but that this affected only the associations among the sentences, not the encoding of the sentences themselves (which is why recognition performance for the text material was apparently preserved, without provision of the title).\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5832\n> Alba and colleagues concluded that provision of the title allowed the participants to integrate the sentences into a more coherent unit, which benefited recall – but that this affected only the associations among the sentences, not the encoding of the sentences themselves (which is why recognition performance for the text material was apparently preserved, without provision of the title).\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5833\n> Bower, Winzenz, and colleagues provided another demonstration.

Asked such a question, you are subsequently likely to ‘insert’ a tree into my memory of the scene, even if there was no tree there in the first place. And once the tree has been inserted, it tends to operate as if it were part of the original memory, so that it is difficult to tell the difference between the real memory and what has been subsequently introduced.\n> ***\n> \n\n> [!notes] 5875\n> On a related topic, other studies have reported situations in which people have been unable to recognize when two people have changed places.
